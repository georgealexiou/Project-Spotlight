# Project Spotlight

We were inspired by the Apple-exclusive tools our lecturers use to present their leictures.We wanted to use our existing hardware to achieve functionality usually sold in hardware-exclusive devices that achieve the given task.

This is why we created Project Spotlight, a trackpad like application for your phone that lets you take control of any computer Mac, Windows and even Linux. While the idea started by a simple presentation clicker it is now a fully functional trackpad with mouse pointer customisations and much more.

We sharpened our knowledge on Java, Python, Multithreaded Client-Server socket comminication, android development, android and windows GUIs, graphics, version controlling, planning, prototyping, scrums, agile practices, AND WORKING WITH ZERO SLEEP!

We faced challenges that seemed ridiculously difficult to solve, took many many hours, and proved to only require the simplest of code alterations for them to work

## How to run it
To run our application you need:
  - Android Phone
  - Windows, Mac, Linux Computer (some dependencies need to be installed)
  
### Step 1
Download the .apk file from the repo to your android device

### Step 2
Find your device's ip adress. You get your IP adress by finding your IPv4 Adress from the listed adresses ny running the following command

> ipconfig

### Step 3
From cmd or terminal run the following (assuming you are in the root directory)
> Python Desktop/server_test.py

> python3 Desktop/server_test.py (mac/linux)

### Step 4
When you open the app on your Android Device input the correct IP Adress in the correct field
